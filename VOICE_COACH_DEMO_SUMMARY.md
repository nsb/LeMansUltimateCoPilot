- **Voice Settings Demo**: Shows different voice configuration options
- **Performance Analysis Demo**: Displays telemetry analysis and personalized coaching recommendations

### 2. **Realistic Data Simulation**
- **Track Configuration**: Le Mans Circuit de la Sarthe with 5 detailed segments
- **Reference Lap**: Optimal 3:18.5 lap time with complete telemetry data
- **Scenario-Based Telemetry**: 8 different driving scenarios (optimal, late braking, understeer, etc.)
- **Real-time Timing**: Simulates actual race timing with millisecond precision

### 3. **Mock Services for Demonstration**
- **MockLLMCoachingService**: Generates realistic coaching messages with random variations
- **MockVoiceOutputService**: Simulates voice output with timing delays
- **MockRealTimeComparisonService**: Provides dynamic comparison metrics

### 4. **Integration with Main Application**
- Added 'd' key option to the main program menu
- Seamless integration with existing rFactor2 telemetry system
- Proper cleanup and return to main menu functionality

## Technical Implementation

### Fixed Issues
1. **Property Name Corrections**: Fixed LLMConfiguration, TrackSegment, and EnhancedTelemetryData property names
2. **Event Handler Implementation**: Added proper OnCoachingProvided event handling
3. **Model Compatibility**: Ensured all models use correct property names and types
4. **Service Architecture**: Implemented proper inheritance and method signatures

### Mock Service Architecture
```csharp
// Mock services inherit from actual services for realistic behavior
public class MockLLMCoachingService : LLMCoachingService
public class MockVoiceOutputService : VoiceOutputService  
public class MockRealTimeComparisonService : RealTimeComparisonService
```

### Demo Data Structure
- **Track Segments**: 5 realistic Le Mans track segments with proper segment types
- **Telemetry Data**: 160 telemetry samples across 8 different scenarios
- **Reference Data**: 100 reference telemetry points for comparison
- **Coaching Messages**: 8 different coaching scenarios with realistic feedback

## User Experience

1. **Initialization**: Sets up mock services and generates realistic demo data
2. **Menu Navigation**: Clean, intuitive menu system with numbered options
3. **Real-time Simulation**: Live telemetry display with coaching feedback
4. **Interactive Control**: User can pause, continue, or exit at any time
5. **Comprehensive Coverage**: All major coaching scenarios demonstrated

### Console Output Features
- **Rich Visual Feedback**: Emojis and formatted console output
- **Real-time Updates**: Live telemetry data display
- **Status Indicators**: Clear progress and completion messages
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages

## Integration Points

### Main Program Integration
- Added demo option to main menu help text
- Implemented `RunVoiceCoachDemo()` method in Program.cs
- Proper exception handling and cleanup
- Seamless return to main application

### Service Integration
- Compatible with existing VoiceDrivingCoach service
